/**
 * The CMS SDK.
 *
 * This is the only thing a frontend developer needs to import:
 *
 *   import { cms } from "@/lib/cms";
 *
 *   const page  = await cms.pages.getBySlug("/about");
 *   const menu  = await cms.navigation.get("main");
 *   const site  = await cms.settings.get();
 *
 * Nothing in this object leaks the storage provider. Swapping Supabase for
 * MongoDB is a one-line change in cms.config.ts and no frontend file changes.
 *
 * It is server-only by design: every method reaches a database with privileged
 * credentials. Fetch in a Server Component (or a Server Action / route
 * handler) and pass plain data to Client Components.
 *
 * `activities` is the content type; `activity` is the audit log. The names
 * are one letter apart and mean entirely different things.
 *
 * `cms.enquiries` is the inbox behind the public contact form. It is the one
 * namespace with no public read: never surface it from a page.
 *
 * See docs/ROADMAP.md.
