 * `app/about/page.tsx` so it can show that in the admin, let an editor manage
 * its metadata, and warn when a CMS page would be shadowed by a hard route.
 *
 * The approach: developers *declare* their routes in `config/routes.ts`. No
 * filesystem walking and no source parsing at runtime — both are fragile, and
 * neither works once the app is bundled. Declaration is a two-line change that
 * a WordPress developer immediately understands, and it is the only mechanism
 * that stays correct in production.
 *
 * Drift is caught by `npm run cms:routes`, a development-time script that
 * compares `app/` against this registry and reports anything unregistered.
