/**
 * The database contract every backend must satisfy.
 *
 * Design notes
 * ------------
 * 1. The interface is deliberately *narrow*. Supabase (Postgres), MongoDB and
 *    Firestore do not have the same query capabilities; anything that only one
 *    of them can do is not in here. Richer behaviour is composed above this
 *    layer, in `lib/cms/repositories/*`.
 * 2. Adapters expose generic collections rather than one method per content
 *    type. That keeps a new adapter to a few hundred lines instead of a few
 *    thousand, and means adding a content model needs no adapter changes.
 * 3. Records are plain JSON-serialisable objects. Adapters own the translation
 *    between their native representation (Postgres rows, BSON documents,
 *    Firestore snapshots) and these shapes.
