/**
 * Maps a verified external identity onto a CMS user.
 *
 * Every third-party provider funnels through here, so the rules are stated
 * once instead of three slightly different times.
 *
 * The rules, and why:
 *
 * 1. Match on email. That is the one identifier every provider exposes and
 *    that an administrator can reasonably be asked to type into the Users
 *    screen.
 *
 * 2. If no CMS user exists at all, the first person to sign in becomes the
 *    super admin. Without this a project that starts on Clerk could never
 *    bootstrap: there would be nobody able to create the first user.
 *
 * 3. Otherwise, an unknown email is REFUSED rather than auto-provisioned.
 *    Auto-creating an account for anyone who can sign up with the identity
 *    provider would mean a public Clerk sign-up page is a public admin
 *    sign-up page. An administrator invites people by creating the CMS user
 *    first; the provider then just proves they are who they say.
 *
 * 4. A deactivated CMS user is refused regardless of what the provider says.
 *
 * 5. A traveller is refused. Travellers share the `users` collection with
 *    staff, so a customer who happens to hold an account with the client's
 *    identity provider would otherwise match at step 1 and be handed an admin
 *    session. It would be a powerless one — the role grants nothing — but
 *    "signed in, then bounced" is not an answer, and the rule belongs here
 *    where every provider passes through it rather than in each sign-in page.
