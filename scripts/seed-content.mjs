It rises from the Dudh Koshi river at around 2,800 metres to the south face of Everest itself, and almost everyone who walks it arrives the same way — on a sixteen-minute flight into Lukla, then north on foot.

## What the walking is like

Trails here are old trade routes, not wilderness paths. They are wide, well graded and busy with porters and yak trains carrying everything the valley eats. You sleep in lodges, eat cooked food and never carry more than a day pack if you do not want to.

What makes the Khumbu hard is not the terrain. It is the altitude. Namche sits at 3,440 metres, and by Gorak Shep you are above 5,100. Every itinerary we run here builds in two acclimatisation days, and we would rather turn a group around than push it.

## The Sherpa valley

Khumbu is Sherpa country, and it has been Buddhist for four centuries. Tengboche is the largest monastery in the region and still a working one; if you are there in October or November you may walk into the middle of Mani Rimdu. Treat the mani walls and chortens as you would any place of worship — pass them on the left.`,

## Two very different routes

The **Sanctuary** trek climbs into a glacial amphitheatre at Annapurna Base Camp, 4,130 metres, enclosed on every side. It is the shorter and more dramatic of the two, and it can be walked in ten days.

The **Circuit** goes the long way round the massif and crosses the Thorong La at 5,416 metres — a serious pass, and the reason the Circuit needs more acclimatisation than its gentle first week suggests.

## Getting there

Everything starts in Pokhara, a lakeside town 200 kilometres west of Kathmandu, twenty-five minutes by air or six hours by road. It is a good place to lose a day at either end of a trek, and most people do.`,

## After 2015

The earthquake of April 2015 buried Langtang village under a landslide and killed most of the people in it. The village has been rebuilt slightly to the east, the trail is fully open, and the lodges are run by families who came back. Trekking here is the main livelihood in the valley, and going is the most useful thing a visitor can do.

## The walking

Three days up a steep forested gorge, then the valley opens out at Kyanjin Gompa, 3,870 metres, below a wall of ice. Most people spend a day there climbing Kyanjin Ri or Tserko Ri for the view down the whole valley, and buying yak cheese from the small factory the Swiss set up in the 1950s.`,

## Upper Mustang

North of Kagbeni the district becomes restricted, and you need a special permit, a licensed guide and a minimum of two trekkers. Behind that line is Lo, a Tibetan Buddhist kingdom that was closed to outsiders until 1992 and whose capital, Lo Manthang, is still a walled town of whitewashed houses around three fifteenth-century monasteries.

## When to go

The one region in Nepal you can trek through the monsoon. June to August is dry here and every other trail in the country is wet — it is the obvious answer to "where can I walk in July?"`,

## The route

North from Lukla along the Dudh Koshi, over a string of suspension bridges to Namche Bazaar. Then east past Tengboche monastery to Dingboche, and up the Khumbu valley to Lobuche and Gorak Shep. Twelve days of walking, two of them spent going nowhere so your body can catch up.

## Who it suits

Anyone who can walk six hours a day, several days running, and is content to do it slowly. No technical skill is required and no previous trekking experience is assumed. What it does require is patience with the altitude schedule — the people who have trouble here are almost always the fit ones who wanted to go faster.`,

## Getting in

From Pokhara it is a short drive to the trailhead and then five days of climbing: terraced farmland, then rhododendron forest, then bamboo, then bare moraine. You gain over 3,000 metres, which is why the itinerary breaks the last section into two short days.

March and April for rhododendron in flower; October and November for the clearest air of the year. Avoid the Sanctuary in mid-winter — the gorge is avalanche-prone after heavy snow.`,

## The permit

## How we run it

Groups of four to twelve, one guide to every four trekkers, and one porter to every two. We use the twelve-day walking schedule rather than the ten-day one that some operators sell, because the shorter version puts people at Lobuche without a second acclimatisation day and it is the commonest reason a trek fails.

## What it asks of you

Six to seven hours of walking a day on a good trail, at altitude, for eleven days running. No technical skill. No previous trek necessary. A reasonable base of hill-walking fitness and the willingness to walk more slowly than feels natural.`,

## Why eleven days

The Sanctuary can be walked in eight. We take eleven because the final approach gains height quickly and because the two days it buys — one at Deurali, one on the way out at Jhinu — are the difference between a hard trek and a good one.

## Fitness

Less altitude than Everest, more stairs. The stone staircases between Chhomrong and Bamboo are genuinely punishing on the descent, and trekking poles are not optional here.`,

## Going back to Langtang

The 2015 earthquake destroyed Langtang village and killed most of the people in it. The valley has been rebuilt and the lodges are run by families who chose to return to a place that has one industry. This is the trek we recommend to people who ask which of ours does the most good.

## Practicalities

The drive to Syabrubesi is seven hours on a rough road and it is the least pleasant part of the trip. Everything after it is straightforward.`,

## The permit

Upper Mustang is a restricted area: a special permit is required in addition to the Annapurna conservation permit, it can only be issued through a licensed agency, and there is a minimum of two trekkers in a party. It is the largest single cost in this trip and it is non-refundable once issued.

## Why the monsoon works here

The Himalaya takes the rain out of the air before it gets this far north. June to August is dry, warm and green with barley — the only good trekking in Nepal during the months when everywhere else is under cloud.`,

## The shape of the trip

Nine days of acclimatisation on the Everest trail, two days of skills training at Chhukung, then base camp, a summit day that starts at one in the morning, and a spare day in case the weather takes the first attempt.

## What we ask

You should be a competent hill walker, comfortable with exposure, and fit enough for a 1,000-metre ascent starting in the dark at 5,200 metres. We teach everything technical on the mountain — rope work, crampons, jumar — and we run one climbing guide to every two climbers on summit day.`,

      daysAgo: 12,
      content: `Every operator publishes a kit list. Most of them are the manufacturer's catalogue with the prices removed. This one is the list our guides actually check at the briefing, with notes on what matters.

## The three things that decide your trek

**Boots you have already walked in.** Not new boots. Not boots you wore twice on a weekend. Two hundred kilometres of trail is not where you discover a hot spot. If your boots are new, wear them every day for a month before you fly.

**A four-season sleeping bag.** Lodges heat the dining room and nothing else. At Gorak Shep in November the bedroom drops to −10 °C. We lend a bag rated to −20 °C and it is included; bring your own only if you like it better.

**A down jacket.** Also lent, also included. You will live in it from Dingboche onwards.

## Layers, in the order you will put them on

- Two merino base layers, long sleeved. Merino because you will wear each of them for four days.
- A fleece or light synthetic midlayer.
- A hard shell jacket, properly waterproof. It rains below Namche in April.
- Trekking trousers, two pairs, one of them lined.
- A down jacket for mornings, evenings and the whole of the last four days.

## What people always bring and never use

1. **A water filter pump.** Boiled water is sold at every lodge and it is cheaper than the fuel to purify your own. Bring purification tablets as a backup and leave the pump at home.
2. **Jeans.** They are heavy, they are cold, and wet denim does not dry at 4,000 metres.
3. **A full first aid kit.** Your guide carries one. Bring your own personal medication, blister plasters and painkillers, and nothing else.
4. **More than two books.** Weight is carried by a person.

## The small things that matter more than they should

A head torch with a fresh battery, because the dining room lights go off at nine. A power bank, because charging costs USD 3 an hour above Namche. Lip balm with sun protection — the combination of altitude, dry air and reflected snow does real damage. And ear plugs: teahouse walls are plywood.

## Luggage

Your porter carries one duffel, 20 kg maximum between two of you, and we lend the duffel. You carry a day pack of 25–30 litres with water, a layer, your camera and your documents. Anything you do not need on the trek stays in the hotel in Kathmandu at no charge.`,

      content: `Altitude is the single largest risk on a Himalayan trek, and it is also the most manageable. Almost everyone who gets into serious trouble does so for one of two reasons: they went up too fast, or they kept going after their body said not to.

## What is actually happening

Above about 2,500 metres there is measurably less oxygen in each breath. Your body responds by breathing faster and making more red blood cells, and that adjustment takes days. Go up faster than it can adjust and fluid begins to leak into tissue — first the brain, which is acute mountain sickness, and in rare cases the lungs.

## The symptoms, in the order they usually arrive

- **Headache.** Nearly universal above 4,000 metres and not alarming on its own.
- **Poor sleep**, often with periodic breathing that wakes you gasping. Unpleasant, normal.
- **Loss of appetite** and mild nausea.
- **Fatigue out of proportion** to the day's walking.

Mild AMS is a headache plus one of the others. It is common, it is not dangerous, and the correct response is to stop climbing — not to descend, just to stop — until it clears.

## When it stops being routine

Get to lower ground immediately, at any hour, if you see:

- **Ataxia** — an inability to walk a straight line heel to toe. This is the single most reliable sign, and it is the one our guides test.
- **Confusion**, strange behaviour or unusual drowsiness.
- **Breathlessness at rest**, or a wet, bubbling cough.

These are HACE and HAPE. Both are life-threatening and both improve dramatically with descent. Six hundred metres down is usually enough to transform the picture.

## The rule with no exceptions

**Descent is never wrong.** Not once in fourteen seasons has anyone regretted going down. Plenty have regretted going up.

Our guides carry a pulse oximeter and record everyone's saturation each evening. It is a useful trend, not a verdict — a single low reading in a cold hand means very little. What matters is the direction of travel and how you feel walking.

## What actually prevents it

Walk slowly. Slower than feels reasonable. The fit young trekkers are the ones who get into trouble, because they can outpace their own acclimatisation.

Drink three to four litres a day. Sleep no more than 500 metres higher than the night before above 3,000 metres, and take a rest day every 1,000. Both our Everest itineraries are built on exactly this.

Acetazolamide (Diamox) genuinely works as a preventative — 125 mg twice daily, started the day before you go high. Talk to your own doctor before you fly, not to a pharmacy in Thamel.

Alcohol and sleeping tablets both suppress breathing at night. Leave them alone above Namche.`,

      content: `Nepal has two trekking seasons and two that people are told to avoid. The received wisdom is roughly right and misses a good deal.

## October and November — the best air of the year

The monsoon clears in the first days of October and takes the dust with it. Visibility is extraordinary, days are warm, nights are cold and clear. It is the finest trekking weather on earth and everyone knows it: Namche in the third week of October is busy, and lodges at Gorak Shep can run out of rooms.

Book early, start early each morning, and accept that you are sharing the trail.

## March, April and May — flowers and haze

Spring is warmer and much quieter than autumn. Rhododendron forest between 2,000 and 3,500 metres flowers scarlet through March and April, which is reason enough on its own for Annapurna.

The trade-off is haze. Dust and agricultural burning build through spring, and by May the middle-distance views are milky even when the peaks are clear. Go high, above the haze layer, and it hardly matters.

May is also the Everest summit season, so the Khumbu is full of expedition traffic — more interesting than inconvenient.

## June to September — the monsoon

Rain most afternoons, cloud most mornings, leeches in the forest below 3,000 metres, and flights to Lukla and Jomsom cancelled for days at a time. Not the season for Everest or Annapurna.

It is, however, the only season for **Mustang and Dolpo**, which sit north of the main Himalayan chain and stay dry. Green barley, clear skies and empty trails, in the months when everyone else has gone home. If your holiday is fixed to July, this is where you go.

## December to February — cold and completely clear

Underrated. The air after the autumn crowds have gone is as clear as October and the trails are empty. Everest Base Camp is entirely walkable in December, and many lodges stay open.

It is properly cold — −20 °C at Gorak Shep is normal in January — and some high lodges close. The Annapurna Sanctuary is the one place we avoid, because the approach gorge is avalanche-prone after heavy snow.

## The short version

| If you want | Go |
|---|---|
| The clearest possible views | Late October to early December |
| Rhododendron in flower | Mid-March to late April |
| Empty trails and hard frost | December and January |
| To walk in the monsoon | Upper Mustang, June to August |
| Everest without the crowds | Early December |`,

      daysAgo: 58,
      content: `Tenzing-Hillary Airport sits at 2,840 metres on a shelf cut into the hillside above Lukla. The runway is 527 metres long, slopes uphill at about 12 per cent so that gravity helps aircraft stop, and ends at a stone wall. There is no instrument approach and no go-around: once committed, a pilot lands.

It is also completely routine. Twin Otters and Dorniers have been flying it since 1964, the pilots who fly it are the most experienced in the country, and the whole thing takes sixteen minutes.

## Why flights are cancelled

Not wind, usually — cloud. The approach is visual, and the valley fills in. A morning that is clear in Kathmandu can be closed at Lukla and the other way round, so aircraft sometimes take off and turn back.

Flights go in the morning, almost always before eleven, because the valley wind builds through the day. If you are not away by lunchtime you are not going.

Cancellations are more common in the monsoon, and common enough in the shoulder weeks of any season to plan around.

## Kathmandu or Manthali

In the busy weeks of spring and autumn, Lukla flights are moved from Kathmandu to Manthali in Ramechhap, a four-hour drive east of the capital, to reduce congestion. That means a two o'clock departure from your hotel and a flight at first light.

It is unglamorous and it is genuinely more reliable — the Manthali approach is shorter and less weather-dependent. When our itineraries say the transfer leaves at 2 a.m., this is why.

## How to plan around it

**Build in a contingency day.** Every one of our Everest itineraries holds a spare day in Kathmandu at the end for exactly this. A trek without one is a trek that gambles your international flight.

**Do not book a tight onward connection.** Give yourself 48 hours in Kathmandu after the scheduled return.

**Know the helicopter option.** When aircraft are grounded for days, helicopters often still fly, and a shared charter out of Lukla runs around USD 500 a head with five aboard. Some travel insurance covers it as a delay expense; most does not.

## What the flight is actually like

Loud, and over quickly. Sit on the left going up for the best of the Himalaya. The landing looks alarming from the window and is not — you will be on the ground and walking within three minutes of the wheels touching, because the aircraft is turning straight round to go back.`,

      daysAgo: 74,
      content: `Teahouse trekking is the reason Nepal is walkable by people who would never carry a tent. Every village on the main trails has lodges, and they have been taking in trekkers for fifty years.

## The room

Plywood walls, two single beds with a foam mattress, a blanket, a window that does not seal. No heating. At 4,000 metres your bedroom is the outside temperature plus a degree or two, which is why the sleeping bag matters and the room does not.

Higher up, the rooms get simpler and colder. At Gorak Shep they are essentially a box.

## The dining room

Where everything actually happens. One stove burning yak dung or kerosene in the middle, benches round the walls, and everyone in the village's trekking population in it from five in the evening. You eat, you play cards, you talk to people from six countries, and at nine o'clock the generator goes off and everyone goes to bed.

The economics are worth knowing: lodges charge almost nothing for a room — often USD 3 to 5 — and make their money on food. Eat where you sleep. Arriving, eating elsewhere and coming back to sleep is a real discourtesy.

## The food

**Dal bhat** is lentil soup, rice, curried vegetable and pickle, and it comes with free refills. This is not a promotional gimmick; it is the deal, and it is why every guide and porter in Nepal eats it twice a day. Order it and you will be fed until you stop.

Beyond dal bhat, expect fried rice, noodle soup, momo dumplings, potatoes in several forms, porridge, eggs and apple pie — which is everywhere above Namche and better than it has any right to be.

Two pieces of advice our guides give without exception: **do not eat meat above Namche** — it has walked up for two days unrefrigerated — and eat vegetarian generally. A stomach upset at 4,500 metres ends treks.

## What costs money

Everything except the room, and prices climb with altitude because everything is carried:

- Hot shower: USD 3–6
- Charging a phone: USD 2–5 per device
- Wi-Fi: USD 2–8 a day
- Boiled drinking water: USD 1–4 a litre
- A pot of tea: USD 2–5

Budget USD 30–40 a day above what your trek includes, and carry small notes — there are no cash machines past Namche.

## The etiquette

Take your boots off at the door. Pass mani walls and chortens on the left, which keeps them on your right. Ask before photographing anyone. Do not ask for a discount on a room; the margin you are haggling over is the family's income and it is already close to nothing.`,

      daysAgo: 96,
      content: `Nepal's permit system is straightforward once you know which of three categories your trek falls into. If you are booked with an agency, all of this is arranged for you — but it is worth understanding what you are paying for.

## Category one: the national parks and conservation areas

Everest, Annapurna and Langtang all fall here. You need two things:

**The park or conservation area permit.** Sagarmatha National Park is NPR 3,000 for foreign nationals; the Annapurna Conservation Area and Langtang National Park are the same. Issued in Kathmandu or Pokhara, or at the park entrance.

**A trekking registration.** The TIMS card, NPR 2,000 through a registered agency. The Khumbu is the exception — since 2018 it has used its own rural municipality permit instead, NPR 2,000, bought at Lukla or Monjo.

## Category two: restricted areas

Upper Mustang, Dolpo, Manaslu, Nar Phu and Kanchenjunga. These need a special permit on top of the conservation permit, and three conditions apply without exception:

1. It must be issued through a licensed Nepali trekking agency. You cannot apply yourself.
2. There is a **minimum of two trekkers** in the party.
3. A licensed guide must accompany you.

Upper Mustang is USD 500 per person for ten days, then USD 50 a day. Manaslu is USD 100 per person a week in the high season. These are per-person and non-refundable once issued, which is why we ask for the permit portion at booking rather than on arrival.

## Category three: everything else

Some short treks in the middle hills need no permit at all.

## The guide requirement

Since April 2023 the Nepal Tourism Board has required trekkers in national parks and conservation areas to be accompanied by a licensed guide. Solo trekking on the main trails is no longer permitted.

Enforcement varies by checkpost and the rule has been argued about a great deal. We follow it as written.

## What you need to hand over

- Your **passport**, valid six months beyond your return date.
- **Two to four passport photographs.** Bring six; they get used up.
- Your **visa**, which most nationalities can buy on arrival at Kathmandu airport — USD 30 for 15 days, USD 50 for 30, USD 125 for 90, in cash.
- Your **insurance certificate**, showing helicopter evacuation cover and the altitude it extends to.

## Rough total

For a standard Everest Base Camp trek, permits come to around USD 55 per person. For Upper Mustang, USD 530. The difference is the whole reason Mustang costs what it does.`,

Mission Himalaya began in 2011 with two guides, a rented desk in Thamel and a website built over a winter. We now run around 140 departures a year with twelve full-time guides and a seasonal crew of about forty porters.

We have deliberately not grown faster than that. The thing that makes a trek good is the person walking in front of you, and there is a limit to how many of those you can find, train and keep.

## What we do differently

**We employ our guides, we do not hire them per trip.** They are on a salary through the monsoon, when nobody is trekking and every freelance guide in Nepal is looking for work. It costs us more and it is why our people stay.

**Our porters carry 20 kg, not 35.** The load limit is ours, not the law's. They are insured to the same level as the guides, equipped by us, and paid above the union rate.

**We build in the acclimatisation days that the cheap itineraries cut.** A ten-day Everest Base Camp trek exists and we will not sell one.

**We would rather turn you around.** Not one guide on our staff has ever been questioned for bringing a client down early, and several have been thanked for it.`,

Porter welfare is the part of Nepali trekking that the industry is worst at, so we will be specific.

- **Load limit: 20 kg per porter.** The Nepal government's guidance is 30 and the International Porter Protection Group recommends 20. We use the lower number.
- **Insurance for every member of staff**, covering helicopter rescue to the altitude of the trek they are on. It is checked before each departure.
- **Equipment provided, not deducted**: boots, jacket, sleeping bag, gloves and sunglasses, issued by us and kept by them.
- **Salaried guides, paid through the monsoon.** Twelve months of pay for eight months of work.
- **The same lodges, the same food.** Our crew eat and sleep where our clients do.

## What we carry out

Every departure carries out its own waste, including the batteries and packaging that lodges cannot dispose of. Since 2019 we have also carried a share of what we find: an average of 11 kg of other people's rubbish per Everest departure.

We do not sell bottled water. Every trekker gets a filter bottle to keep, and boiled water is included in the trip price so there is no incentive to buy plastic. A fourteen-day Everest trek that buys three litres a day puts 42 bottles into a valley with no way to remove them.

## What we have not solved

**Flights.** A Lukla flight is the only practical way into the Khumbu and it is carbon-expensive. We offset every domestic flight we book through a cookstove programme in Nuwakot, and we know an offset is not the same as not flying.

**Helicopter evacuation fraud.** Nepal has a real problem with unnecessary evacuations billed to insurers. We evacuate on a guide's clinical judgement and never on a commission, and we will always give you the written record.

**Seasonality.** Two-thirds of our income arrives in ten weeks of the year. That is hard on the whole industry and we have not found a way round it.`,

Your passport must be valid for six months beyond your return date. Most nationalities can buy a visa on arrival at Kathmandu airport: USD 30 for 15 days, USD 50 for 30 days, USD 125 for 90 days, payable in cash. Bring the exact amount and two passport photographs.

## Insurance — read this twice

This is the one thing we cannot arrange for you and the one thing that matters most.

Your policy must cover **helicopter evacuation** and it must extend to **the maximum altitude of your trek**. Many standard policies stop at 4,000 metres, which does not reach Everest Base Camp. For Island Peak you need cover to 6,500 metres and an explicit mountaineering clause.

We ask for your certificate before departure and we do check the altitude limit.

## Vaccinations

No vaccination is required to enter Nepal. Commonly recommended are hepatitis A, typhoid, tetanus and, for longer stays, rabies and Japanese encephalitis. Malaria is a consideration in the Terai — Chitwan — but not in the hills. Speak to a travel clinic eight weeks before you fly.

## Money

Nepali rupees, and cash above Namche or Chhomrong. Cash machines exist in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Namche and nowhere higher; the Namche machine runs out.

Budget USD 30–40 a day on trek for drinks, showers, charging and Wi-Fi. Bring USD in cash for the visa and for permits, in clean notes — torn or marked bills are refused.

Tipping is customary and not obligatory. The usual guidance is 10 per cent of the trip cost, split roughly two-thirds to the guide and one-third across the porters, given at the end.

## Training

Whatever you do, do it with a loaded pack on hills. Twelve weeks out, aim for one long walk a week building to six hours with 700 metres of ascent, plus two shorter sessions.

Altitude cannot be trained for at sea level, and cardiovascular fitness does not predict who acclimatises well. What fitness buys you is the capacity to enjoy the walking rather than endure it.

## A week before you fly

- Confirm your insurance certificate shows the right altitude.
- Break in your boots, properly.
- Photograph your passport, visa, insurance and flight details, and email them to yourself.
- Tell your bank you are travelling.
- Pack your day pack and carry it around for an hour. It is heavier than you think.`,

      question: "Do I need a visa for Nepal?",
      answer:
        "Most nationalities can buy a visa on arrival at Kathmandu airport: USD 30 for 15 days, USD 50 for 30 and USD 125 for 90, payable in cash. Bring two passport photographs and a passport valid for six months beyond your return date. A handful of nationalities must apply in advance — check with your nearest Nepali embassy.",
    },
    {
      key: "permits-arranged",
      category: "Visas and permits",
      question: "Do you arrange trekking permits?",
      answer:
        "Yes. National park and conservation area permits, trekking registration and restricted-area permits are all included in the trip price and arranged by us. We need your passport for a day in Kathmandu to do it. Restricted-area permits for Upper Mustang and Manaslu are non-refundable once issued, which is why that portion is taken at booking.",
    },
    {
      key: "solo-guide",
      category: "Visas and permits",
      question: "Can I trek solo without a guide?",
      answer:
        "Not in the national parks and conservation areas. Since April 2023 the Nepal Tourism Board has required trekkers in those areas to be accompanied by a licensed guide, and restricted areas have required both a guide and a minimum party of two for much longer.",
    },
    {
      key: "fitness",
      category: "Before you book",
      question: "How fit do I need to be?",
      answer:
        "For a teahouse trek: fit enough to walk six to seven hours a day, several days running, at a deliberately slow pace. That is less than people fear. Train by walking hills with a loaded pack rather than by running. Altitude tolerance and cardiovascular fitness are not the same thing, and fitness does not predict who acclimatises well.",
    },
    {
      key: "insurance",
      category: "Before you book",
      question: "What travel insurance do I need?",
      answer:
        "A policy covering helicopter evacuation to the maximum altitude of your trek. Many standard policies stop at 4,000 metres, which does not cover Everest Base Camp at 5,364. For a climbing trip you need explicit mountaineering cover to 6,500 metres. We ask to see the certificate before departure and we do check the altitude.",
    },
    {
      key: "age-limits",
      category: "Before you book",
      question: "Is there an age limit?",
      answer:
        "No upper limit. Our oldest Everest Base Camp client was 74 and our oldest Island Peak summiteer was 61. For high-altitude treks we ask trekkers over 65 for a doctor's letter. For the low-altitude cultural and jungle trips, children from about six upwards do very well.",
    },
    {
      key: "altitude-risk",
      category: "On the trail",
      question: "What happens if I get altitude sickness?",
      answer:
        "Mild symptoms — headache, poor sleep, no appetite — are common above 4,000 metres and are managed by not going higher until they clear. Your guide records oxygen saturation each evening and carries a first aid kit. If descent is needed, you descend, at any hour, and a guide goes with you. Serious cases are evacuated by helicopter on the guide's clinical judgement.",
    },
    {
      key: "food-water",
      category: "On the trail",
      question: "What is the food like, and can I drink the water?",
      answer:
        "Dal bhat — lentils, rice, vegetable curry — with free refills, plus noodles, momos, potatoes, eggs, porridge and surprisingly good apple pie. Vegetarian and vegan diets are easy; tell us about allergies at booking. Never drink untreated water. Boiled water is included in your trip price and we give every trekker a filter bottle to keep, so there is no reason to buy plastic.",
    },
    {
      key: "charging-wifi",
      category: "On the trail",
      question: "Can I charge my phone and get online?",
      answer:
        "Yes, on all the main trails, and both cost money — expect USD 2 to 5 per device to charge and USD 2 to 8 a day for Wi-Fi, rising with altitude. Bring a power bank. Mobile data works surprisingly far up the Khumbu on an Ncell or NTC local SIM, which is cheaper than lodge Wi-Fi.",
    },
    {
      key: "flight-cancelled",
      category: "Getting there",
      question: "What if my Lukla flight is cancelled?",
      answer:
        "It happens, mostly to cloud. Every Everest itinerary we run holds a contingency day in Kathmandu at the end for exactly this. If the delay runs longer we will arrange a shared helicopter at cost — typically USD 500 a head with five aboard. Never book a tight onward connection after a Lukla trek.",
    },
    {
      key: "payment",
      category: "Booking and payment",
      question: "How do I pay, and what is the deposit?",
      answer:
        "A 20 per cent deposit confirms a departure, with the balance due 30 days before arrival — or on arrival in Kathmandu, in cash, if you prefer. We take bank transfer and card; card payments carry a 4 per cent processing fee that we pass on at cost. Restricted-area permit costs are taken in full at booking because they cannot be refunded.",
    },
    {
      key: "cancellation",
      category: "Booking and payment",
      question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
      answer:
        "More than 45 days before departure: full refund less the deposit. Between 45 and 15 days: 50 per cent of the trip cost. Under 15 days: no refund, though we will transfer your booking to another departure within twelve months once at no charge. Restricted-area permits are non-refundable at any point once issued.",
