# Roadmap

Status as of the Phase 1 delivery. Anything not marked **Done** is not built —
the admin shows unbuilt screens greyed out rather than as links that 404.

and any block editor beyond a single rich-text block.

## Phase 2 — Content

The tourism-specific half. Types are already defined in `types/content.ts`;
these items are the repositories, admin screens and SDK namespaces.

- [x] **Media library** — upload (multi-file, drag and drop), flat folders, alt
      text, caption, search and type filters, copy-URL, delete.
      `/admin/media`, `cms.media`, verified against Supabase Storage.
- [x] **Media picker** wired into the featured-image and OG-image fields via
      `components/cms/image-field.tsx`. Fields still store a plain URL, so a
      CDN address typed by hand stays valid.
- [x] **Blog** — posts with drafts, scheduling, trash and duplication;
      author byline; one category and free tags per post, filterable in the
      list. `/admin/blog`, `cms.posts`. Slugs are bare, not paths: the project
      mounts posts at whatever route it wants.
- [x] **Destinations** — the countries a company sells trips in: name,
      description, FAQs, gallery, featured flag and display order, with the same draft/schedule/
      trash lifecycle as pages. `/admin/destinations`, `cms.destinations`.
- [x] **Tour packages** — pricing with a compare-at price, duration,
      difficulty, group size, altitude, best season, highlights, inclusions and
      exclusions, FAQs, gallery, and a destination reference.
      `/admin/tours`, `cms.tours`.
- [x] **Itinerary editor** — day by day, reorderable, with accommodation,
      meals, altitude, walking time and per-day photographs. Days are
      renumbered 1..n on save, and the schema rejects an itinerary whose length
      contradicts the headline duration.
- [x] **Activities** — name, slug, description, icon token, featured image and
      display order, with the same draft/schedule/trash lifecycle as pages.
      `/admin/activities`, `cms.activities`. The tour editor now has a real
      activity picker.
- [x] **Testimonials** — quote, 1-5 rating, attribution (name, role, company,
      country), optional photograph and tour reference, featured flag.
      `/admin/testimonials`, `cms.testimonials`.
- [x] **FAQs** — question, answer, free-text category and order, grouped for
      rendering by `cms.faqs.getGrouped()`. `/admin/faqs`, `cms.faqs`.
- [x] **Enquiries** — inbox for the contact/booking form. Triage states,
      internal notes, resolved subject. `/admin/enquiries`, `cms.enquiries`.
- [x] **Regions** — the area a trip happens in, inside a destination:
      name, slug, description, free-text country, FAQs, gallery, featured flag and display order, with the same
      draft/schedule/trash lifecycle as everything else. `/admin/regions`,
      `cms.regions`.

      **A content type, not a taxonomy.** A region sells — it earns a page with
      photographs and prose, which a string on a destination cannot carry. That
      is the exception to the rule about categories and tags a few lines below,
      and it is the reason for it.

      **`Destination.region` and `Destination.country` are gone.** They were
      free-text strings duplicating what the Region record now holds; a trip
      links to both a destination and a region by id instead. `Region.country`
      remains free text — the reconciliation into a real reference is still
      open if a client asks for it.

      Regions needed new entries in `COLLECTIONS`, `CMS_MODULES` and the
      permission `RESOURCES` — it was not one of the pre-planned models.

      **Connected to trips.** A tour carries `regionIds`, picked with a
      checkbox list beside Destinations in the trip editor, and
      `cms.tours.getByRegion()` reads them back. Until then a region was an
      island: nothing referenced it and it appeared nowhere on the site.

      `destinationId` became `destinationIds` in the same change, because a
      trip that crosses Nepal and Tibet could previously only claim one. Both
      are filtered in the repository rather than through `contains`, for the
      reason `posts.list` gives about tags.

      **Not built:** no coordinates (a region is an area; a pin at its notional
      centre is wrong more often than useful), no public `/regions` route yet —
      the SDK namespace is there, the project mounts it where it likes. A trip
      page therefore prints its regions as plain text, not links. No inline
      “+ Add New” create from inside the trip editor, and regions are not
      nested under destinations the way a WordPress taxonomy would be.

- [x] **Admin theming is local** — `components/cms/theme.tsx` replaced
      `next-themes`, which is no longer a dependency.

      It rendered its anti-flash `<script>` from inside a Client Component, and
      React 19 warns about that on every client render. The library exposes no
      way to skip it: `nonce` and `scriptProps` only set attributes on a script
      it renders regardless. Here the script is emitted by `app/admin/layout.tsx`
      — a Server Component — so it lands in the HTML and still runs before the
      first paint, and the client half is state only.

      `useTheme()` keeps the same `{ theme, resolvedTheme, setTheme }` shape, so
      the header toggle and the toaster were one-line import changes. Outside
      the provider it reports light rather than throwing, because the public
      site has no theme system by design.

      **The stored preference is read in a lazy `useState` initialiser, not an
      effect** — setState-in-an-effect is forbidden here, and it is unnecessary:
      the script has already set the class, so this state never decides what is
      on screen during the first render.

- [ ] Entity links in the menu editor (`target: "entity"`, stubbed today).

**Testimonials and FAQs carry no slug and no SEO block**, unlike every other
published type. Neither is a page: both are rendered inside somebody else's
page, and giving them URLs would produce thin duplicate content.

**An enquiry is a record, not content.** It extends `BaseRecord`, never
publishes, and has no public read — `cms.enquiries` must not be surfaced from
a page. `create()` accepts only the traveller's own fields, so a crafted form
post cannot file itself as "converted" or write the operator's notes; the
admin triages an enquiry but never edits what was sent.

**Activity ids on a tour survive an activity being hidden.** Ids the picker
cannot show — the activity is in the trash, or the module is switched off for
that client — are posted back as hidden inputs, so saving a tour does not
silently strip tags. Deleting an activity still leaves a dangling id by
design; nothing rewrites tours, and the delete dialog says so.

- [x] **Header and footer settings** — `/admin/settings/header` and
      `/admin/settings/footer`, the last two "Soon" items under Website.
      Header: an announcement bar (text, optional link and link label), a
      sticky toggle, a phone/email toggle and one call-to-action button.
      Footer: a blurb, link columns, social and contact toggles, a copyright
      line and a legal note. Both live on the settings singleton in the
      adapter's key/value area, so neither needed a collection, a permission or
      a line of SQL — `settings.read` / `settings.update` already covered them.

      **A footer column names a menu; it does not carry links.** Columns store
      `{ heading, menuKey }` and the layout resolves each through
      `cms.navigation.get()`, so a URL is edited in one place and every menu
      that points at it follows. The alternative — links typed into the footer
      screen — is how a footer ends up pointing at a page that moved two months
      ago. The cost is that a client must build a menu before they can build a
      column, which the screen says, with a link to Navigation.

      **The hard-coded template links are still the fallback**, for the footer
      exactly as they already were for the header: configure no columns, or
      configure columns whose menus resolve to nothing, and the built-in links
      render. A fresh install has a navigable footer before anyone opens the
      admin.

      **The announcement bar is not inside the sticky header.** The notice
      scrolls away and the navigation stays, which is what a client means by
      "keep the header visible". Both halves of the bar and of the CTA are
      validated together in `superRefine` — a label with no URL and a URL with
      no label are both rejected rather than left for the frontend to guess at.

      **Not built:** a second header layout, per-page header or footer
      overrides, a newsletter signup, and payment or certification badge rows.

- [x] **Enquiries arrive with context.** "Enquire about this trip" and the
      destination page's "Enquire" now link to `/contact?tour=…` or
      `?destination=…`. The contact page restates what the visitor clicked
      through from, preselects the trip, and writes an opening line into the
      message box; the enquiry files with `subjectType`/`subjectId` already
      set, so the inbox shows "Tour: Everest Base Camp Trek" instead of a
      stranger asking about an unnamed trek.

      **The query string is parsed like any other untrusted input**
      (`enquiryPrefillSchema`). A value that is not slug-shaped is rejected
      before any lookup and the page falls back to the plain form, which is the
      honest answer to a mangled link.

      **A chosen trip beats the destination the visitor arrived from.** Both
      would be true; only one is what they asked about. The trip select is
      deliberately unnamed and the subject is posted as a hidden pair, so the
      form can never file two subjects.

**Categories and tags are strings on the post, not their own collections.**
A travel blog has a dozen categories that change twice a year; two more tables
and two more admin screens would cost more than they return. `cms.posts`
derives the facet lists from the posts themselves. Revisit if a client ever
needs per-category descriptions or SEO.

**Not done in the media library, deliberately:** image dimensions (needs a
decoder; the CMS ships no native dependency), nested folders, replacing a file
in place, and knowing which pages reference a file — fields store URLs, not
media ids, so that check would be a guess. The last one is the reason the
delete dialog says what it says.

---

## Phase 3 — Editing experience

- [x] **Block editor** — add, reorder and remove blocks on a page.
      `components/cms/block-editor.tsx`. A list with up/down buttons, not a
      drag-and-drop canvas; the form for each block is generated from its
      registered `fields`, so a project's own block gets an editor for free.
- [x] **Built-in blocks** — text, hero, image, gallery, CTA, destination grid,
      trip grid, activity grid, blog grid, testimonials, FAQ, contact form.
      The grids read published content through the SDK at render time.
- [x] **Block registration docs** — docs/BUILDING-A-SITE.md, "Step 6 — Blocks".
- [x] **Rich text editor** — a WordPress-style toolbar on posts, destinations,
      tours and the Text block: a Paragraph/Heading style menu, bold, italic,
      underline, strike, clear-formatting, lists, quote, code, divider, link
      (Ctrl+K) and unlink, undo/redo, and a full-screen toggle. Placeholder
      text, a live word count, and a sticky toolbar for long posts.
      `components/cms/rich-text-field.tsx`, built on TipTap.

      **The word count is derived from the document, not from TipTap's
      CharacterCount.** It has to agree with the "3 min read" the blog
      publishes, and that number comes from `richDocToPlainText` in the posts
      repository. Two counters that can disagree is worse than one.

      **An empty field stores a document holding one empty paragraph**, not a
      document with no nodes. ProseMirror renders an empty document as nothing
      at all, so there is no paragraph for the placeholder to decorate and no
      caret target. `toEditableRichDoc` is the editor-side shape;
      `RichText` treats a lone empty paragraph as no content, so the frontend
      does not gain a stray blank paragraph.

      **It stores a ProseMirror document, not HTML.** The renderer walks that
      document into React elements, so the CMS still ships no HTML parser and
      no sanitiser and editor-authored content still cannot inject markup —
      the property `components/frontend/rich-text.tsx` had from the start.
      Storing HTML would have been the obvious WordPress imitation and would
      have cost a sanitiser dependency plus a standing XSS surface.

      **Legacy Markdown is read, not migrated.** `lib/rich-text.ts` converts
      the old syntax into the same document on load, so existing content opens
      formatted and nothing rewrites a client's prose behind their back.

- [x] **Images in the editor** — drag a file in, paste a screenshot, pick from
      the media library, or paste an image address. Every route uploads through
      `media.upload()` and inserts the stored URL; alt text is edited inline
      while the image is selected.

      **Nothing is ever embedded as base64.** A pasted screenshot arrives as a
      data URI, and inlining one would put megabytes in a database row and
      break the content size cap. `allowBase64: false` on the extension,
      `isSafeImageSrc` on render, and an upload on paste are three independent
      places that enforce it.

      **Remote addresses are copied, not hotlinked**, so a published page
      cannot break when someone else's site moves the file. Fetching an
      editor-supplied URL is an SSRF risk, so the host is resolved and refused
      if it points anywhere internal — see the note in `media/actions.ts` about
      the DNS rebinding race that check does not close.

      **The editor accepts images only**, unlike the media library, which
      deliberately takes documents, audio and video too.

      **Deliberately not built:** tables, a source/HTML view, per-field toolbar
      configuration, and image captions, sizing or alignment — the Image block
      still owns a full-width figure with a caption.

- [x] **A tab per content section** on the tour, destination, region and
      activity editors, in the client's order: Facts, Pricing, Overview,
      Highlights, Info, Itinerary, Include, Images, FAQs. One section per tab,
      and the tab strip is the only place its name appears — the heading under
      it was the same word twice. The tab list lives at the top of each form;
      the machinery is `components/cms/form-sections.tsx`.

      **SEO is not one of the tabs.** It is about how the page is found rather
      than what is on it, and it reads as a different argument; it keeps its own
      card below the panel, with a shortcut in the right rail
      (`components/cms/seo-jump-card.tsx`) because it is otherwise off the
      bottom of a long form.

      **A hidden tab is hidden, never unmounted**, for the same reason a
      collapsed section is: these forms post with `new FormData(form)`, which
      reads only what is in the DOM.

      **Deliberately not built:** per-user tab memory, a URL fragment per tab,
      and lazy mounting of a tab's fields.

- [x] **Four featured-image shapes plus the gallery** on all four content
      types — normal, horizontal, vertical and a 1920x700 banner —
      in one Images tab. `components/cms/featured-images-field.tsx`, with the
      fallback ladders in `lib/images.ts`. A record that has a vertical image
      renders as a portrait card in listings and one that has not keeps the
      landscape tile, so a grid mixes the two per record.

      **Deliberately not built:** cropping, resizing or any image processing.
      The template still ships no image decoder; a crop is an editorial
      decision and the four slots are how the client makes it. The banner
      dimensions are a hint in the UI, not a validated constraint.

- [x] **"In use" on the Images tab** — every photograph and video the record
      references, collected from the form as it stands: featured slots,
      gallery, itinerary days and anything dropped into a rich text editor.
      Read-only and draggable into any slot; it deliberately does not append to
      the gallery, which is an editorial sequence. `lib/used-media.ts`.

      **The scan is structure-blind** — it parses the form's values and keeps
      what looks like a media address, rather than knowing where each field
      hides its images. A structure-aware version rots the first time a field
      is added. It is manual and on mount, not live: it is far too much work to
      redo on every keystroke.

- [x] **Every record's header says when it was published**, not only when it
      was last saved — the two are rarely the same date, and "last updated an
      hour ago" never answered "is this live?". A scheduled record reads
      "Publishes …" rather than "Published …". `lib/record-meta.ts`.

- [x] **Admin lists show twenty rows and grow by twenty** — "Load next 20"
      rather than page numbers. The window size is `perPage` in the URL, so a
      list stays shareable and works without JavaScript, and page navigation
      takes back over at `MAX_PER_PAGE` so a long collection stays reachable.
      `components/ui/pagination.tsx`.

- [x] **One typeface, Mulish, at a 16px base**, by client instruction —
      `--font-mono` points at it too, so the slug field and the JSON-LD box are
      proportional. That is the accepted trade, not an oversight.

- [x] **Highlights, inclusions and exclusions are one rich text editor each**,
      not a row-per-item list, so the writer chooses bulleted, numbered or no
      list at all. Records written before this hold a `string[]`; both shapes
      are read by `toRichListContent()` and nothing is rewritten until the
      record is next saved. `types/rich-text.ts`, `RichListContent`.

      **Deliberately not migrated.** Rewriting a client's live prose in place
      is a worse risk than reading two shapes.

- [x] **Collapsible sections and the Fast menu** on the tour and destination
      editors: every section starts closed and folds from its header, and the
      Fast menu in the right rail scrolls to one — or, expanded, to a single
      field inside it. The menu itself can be hidden.
      `components/cms/form-sections.tsx` and `form-section-nav.tsx`.

      **The whole right rail sticks, not the Fast menu inside it.** Sticking
      the menu alone was tried first and was wrong: its siblings scrolled up
      underneath it and the Publishing card's heading vanished behind it. Not
      sticking anything was tried next, and jumping to a section then left the
      menu off-screen, so the next jump meant scrolling back up. Moving the
      rail as one unit solves both — nothing inside it moves relative to
      anything else.

      Two details it depends on. `self-start` is load bearing: a grid item
      stretches to its row height by default, which leaves `position: sticky`
      nothing to stick to and silently does nothing. And the rail can outgrow
      the viewport, so it scrolls itself with `overscroll-contain` — without
      that, reaching its end chains the scroll into the page and produces the
      "sticks, then jumps" feel this was meant to remove.

      **The scroll spy reads the observer's own measurements.** Calling
      `getBoundingClientRect()` per section in the callback forced a
      synchronous layout on every scroll tick — eight reflows a frame. Entries
      carry `boundingClientRect`; the result is throttled to one update per
      frame.

      That was one cause of rough scrolling in the admin, not the only one:
      scrolling still stuttered afterwards. The other was `backdrop-blur` on
      the editor's sticky toolbar, which makes the compositor re-sample and
      re-blur everything behind it every frame. It is solid now. If it is ever
      reported again, measure before changing anything — there are no scroll
      listeners anywhere in this codebase, so the cost is compositing or forced
      layout, never a handler.

      **A closed section is hidden, never unmounted.** Tabs or conditional
      rendering would look tidier and would quietly break saving: these forms
      post with `new FormData(event.currentTarget)`, which reads only the
      inputs currently in the DOM, so an unrendered section is a section whose
      fields are silently dropped. Verified rather than assumed — a collapsed
      "The trip" still holds all eighteen of its controls.

      **A rejected save opens every section**, because a collapsed one hides
      its own validation errors, and "fix the highlighted fields" with nothing
      visibly highlighted leaves the editor stuck. One blunt rule beats a map
      from field name to section, which would rot the first time a field moved.

      **The field list under each section is read from the DOM**, not declared
      per form — every `Field` renders a `<label for>`. Controls inside a
      `<fieldset>` are represented by their `<legend>` instead of individually:
      listing the twelve month checkboxes behind "Best season" turned a
      seven-item menu into an eighteen-item one and buried the fields anybody
      would actually navigate to.

      Not added to the post, activity, testimonial or FAQ editors: two or three
      sections do not justify the chrome.

- [x] **Media drawer** — the library docked beside the blog, destination, tour
      and activity editors, with images dragged out onto the featured image, a
      gallery, the SEO image or into the text editor.
      `components/cms/media-drawer.tsx`.
      The fetching lives in `use-media-library.ts`, shared with the picker
      dialog so the two cannot drift; the drag payload is one contract in
      `media-drag.ts`, because five components have to agree on it.

      **A hover highlight tests `dataTransfer.types`, not the payload**: the
      browser refuses `getData()` during `dragover`, so a target that tried to
      read the payload would never light up.

      **The editor checks files before the library payload.** A drag from the
      desktop can also advertise `text/uri-list`, and the other order would
      insert a link to a file that was never uploaded.

- [x] **Dated storage paths** — an upload with no folder is filed under
      `YYYY/MM/DD/HHMMSS/`, keeping the filename it arrived with:
      `2026/09/13/143052/everest-sunrise.jpg`. See the note in
      `lib/storage/adapter.ts` on why the date belongs in the storage key and
      not in the record's flat `folder` field.

      **It is not collision-proof, by choice.** A random serial used to
      guarantee that; the name is preserved instead, so two uploads of the same
      filename in the same second land on one key. Supabase refuses that
      (`upsert: false`) and fails loudly; the local adapter would overwrite
      silently. Second-level precision makes it rare, not impossible.

      The name keeps its case, digits and underscores. Only control characters,
      path separators and the set illegal in a Windows path or a URL are
      stripped — `../` in a filename is a traversal attempt, not a name.

**Not built as blocks, deliberately:** video (an embed is a `<script>` from a
third party and needs a consent decision first), map (same, plus an API key),
features (needs a repeating sub-form the generic field descriptor does not
have), and custom-component (a block that renders arbitrary code is a way to
put a deploy inside the CMS).
- [ ] **Structured data** — automatic JSON-LD for tours (`Trip`/`Product`),
      destinations (`Place`) and posts (`Article`), on top of today's manual field.
- [ ] **Revision history** with restore. The activity log records that a change
      happened; this records what changed.
- [ ] **Wildcard redirects** and hit counters.
- [ ] **Autosave** in the page editor.
- [ ] **Bulk actions** in list views.

---

## Phase 4 — Platform

- [ ] **Verify the remaining live integrations.** The Supabase and Neon
      *database* adapters are verified. Still untested against real accounts:
      - Supabase Auth sign-in
      - Neon Auth (Stack Auth) sign-in
      - Clerk sign-in, provider and middleware wiring
- [ ] **Media migration.** Copying between backends moves database records but
      not files held by the storage adapter.
- [ ] **Verify the MongoDB adapter** against a live cluster; add index creation
      at `init()`.
- [ ] **Implement the Firebase adapter**, or formally drop it. The file
      documents what makes Firestore awkward for this contract.
- [ ] **S3 storage adapter** with presigned browser uploads.
- [x] **Traveller accounts** — sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and a profile on the
      public site. `/account`, `/account/login`, `/account/register`,
      `lib/auth/traveller.ts`, `components/frontend/account-forms.tsx`.

      **A traveller is a role, not a second user store.** They live in the
      `users` collection beside staff, which is one table and one password
      implementation rather than two of each. That is only safe because of
      three things, and all three have to stay true:

      1. `traveller` grants no permission at all. `ROLE_PERMISSIONS.traveller`
         is `[]`, so `requirePermission()` refuses a traveller in every server
         action in the CMS without any of them knowing travellers exist. That
         empty array is the boundary; nothing may be added to it.
      2. Every admin surface offers `STAFF_ROLES`, never `ROLES` — the users
         list, the create form, the role select and the permission matrix.
         `ROLES` is derived as `[...STAFF_ROLES, "traveller"]` so the two
         cannot drift. `roleSchema` parses staff roles only, so a hand-posted
         `role=traveller` is rejected before it reaches a repository.
      3. `users.update()` refuses to move a record across the staff/traveller
         line in either direction, in the repository rather than in the screen.

      **Each door refuses the other's credentials.** Traveller details at
      `/admin/login` and staff details at `/account/login` are both valid and
      both refused, with the session destroyed rather than left to be bounced
      by a layout. Both say "Those details do not match an active account" —
      naming the real reason would confirm the address is registered, which is
      the enumeration the admin form already avoids. `linkExternalIdentity`
      refuses travellers too, so the rule holds for the hosted providers.

      **`isFirstRun()` and the admin user list count staff only.** Left
      implicit, a stranger registering on the public site would have closed the
      setup screen on an install that was never set up, and the client's
      customers would have filled the Users screen.

      **The header link is static.** Deciding between "Sign in" and "Your
      account" there would mean reading the session cookie in the public root
      layout, which opts every page on the site out of static rendering. One
      "Account" link is right either way, and `/account` redirects.

      **Deliberately not built:** password reset and email verification — this
      template ships no mailer, and a reset flow is the first thing a project
      adds for itself. Email is therefore not editable from the profile: with
      nothing to confirm a new address against, an unconfirmed email change is
      an account takeover. Also not built: an admin Customers screen, so
      travellers are currently invisible in the admin (the `customers` module
      and permissions exist, and `users.listTravellers()` is the read it would
      use); social sign-in; and linking an enquiry to the account that filed
      it, which is what would make an account worth having.

      **Traveller sign-in needs the built-in `credentials` provider.** Under a
      hosted provider the CMS does not own the session, so the account screens
      say so instead of rendering a form that posts into nothing.

- [ ] **Custom roles** — edit permission bundles from the admin.
- [ ] **Per-record ownership** so an author edits only their own drafts.
- [ ] **Session revocation** ("sign out everywhere").
- [ ] **CLI** — `create-travel-site <name>` to scaffold a client project.
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy** if it is ever needed. Seams are noted in the code; the
      MVP deliberately does not implement it.
- [ ] **Tests.** There is no test suite yet. The first ones worth writing:
      `lib/database/query.ts` (filter/sort/paginate semantics), slug
      normalisation, the permission matrix, and publication-window logic.
- [ ] **i18n.** `locales` and `defaultLocale` exist in config so the data model
      can absorb translations without a migration; nothing consumes them yet.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **An Integrations screen.** The sidebar carried one as "Soon" without any
  entry here saying what it would do, and the only obvious answer — analytics
  and site-verification IDs — is a card Site Settings has always rendered. A
  greyed-out item is honest when the feature genuinely does not exist; this one
  hid a built feature behind a "Soon" tag instead. Removed from the nav, and
  the module switched off in `cms.config.ts` so it stops appearing as a row in
  the permission matrix. The `RESOURCES` and `CMS_MODULES` keys are left in
  place for a project that wants to build a real one.
- A drag-and-drop visual builder that competes with Elementor.
- Plugin marketplaces, themes, or anything resembling WordPress's extension
  ecosystem.
- Microservices. This is one Next.js app.
- Replacing developers' freedom to write ordinary React and query their own data.
